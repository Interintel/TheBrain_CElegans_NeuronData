<p>Function: AIY neurons are postsynaptic to several olfactory and gustatory sensory neurons, such as ASE, ASI, AWA, AWC and AFD, and are presumed to play an integrative role, processing multiple streams of sensory information. They have a key role in behavioral plasticity in paradigms in which starvation is paired with a thermal or chemical cue (de Bono and Maricq, 2005; Ishihara et al., 2002).<br />
- Functions in thermotaxis; laser ablation of the AIY pair makes the animals cryophilic and impaired in isothermal tracking (Mori and Ohshima, 1995). The thermal information sensed by AFD, AWC and ASI is processed in downstream interneurons AIY, AIZ, RIA, and also likely in AIA and AIB (the first three are considered as thermotaxis core interneurons) (Ma and Shen, 2012; Sasakura and Mori, 2012; Ardiel and Rankin, 2011; Beverly et al, 2011). The activation of AIY neuron-signaling drive warm-seeking (thermophilic) movement, the activation of AIZ neuron-signaling drive cold-seeking (cryophilic) movement, while the counterbalancing between the AIY and AIZ signals through the RIA interneuron leads to execution of motor output in response to thermal signals (Ohnishi et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008). AIY is the major postsynaptic partner of AWC and AFD. AWC-derived glutamatergic signals stimulate AIY and induce migration to warmer temperature (Ohnishi et al, 2011). AFD transmits both inhibitory and stimulatory signals to AIY such that calcium concentration threshold in AFD acts as a switch for opposing neural signals to AIY that direct opposite (warm- or cold-seeking) behaviors (Kuhara et al., 2011). AFD-derived glutamatergic signals inhibit AIY through activation of GLC-3 glutamate-gated chloride channel and drive migration towards colder temperature. Recent studies suggest this AFD / AIY synapse may have evolved for reliable transmission of a scaled-down temperature signal from AFD, enabling AIY to monitor and integrate temperature with other sensory inputs (Narayan et al, 2011). The molecular mechanism of the stimulatory signaling between AFD and AIY is currently unknown.<br />
- Functions in locomotion: Suppresses turns and reversals enhancing smooth forward movements and dispersal, since laser ablation of AIY increases reversals and turns, disrupts dispersal behavior and shortens forward movements (Gray et al., 2005; Wakayabashi et al., 2004 ; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003). Similar to AIY, laser ablations of ASE or AIA increases the frequency of reversals while ablations of AWC, AIB or AIZ decreases the frequency of reversals (ablations of RIA does not affect turning rates). Since ablations of AIY and AIZ (the major postsynaptic partner of AIY) cause opposite behavioral phenotpes, the synapses made by AIY onto AIZ may be inhibitory. Alternatively, signals fom AIY to AIZ are processed in a downstream neuron such as RIA (de Bono and Maricq 2005).<br />
- Functions in information processing within the AWC-AIB-AIY circuit that controls food- and odor-evoked behaviors (Chalasani et al., 2007). AWC neurons are activated by food or odor removal and activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors, while they inhibit AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels; odor presentation relieves this inhibition and results in activation of AIY interneurons. The opposite regulation of AIY and AIB interneurons generates a coordinated behavioral response.<br />
- Regulates lifespan and starvation response (starvation induces heat-shock resistance, oxidative stress resistance and extension of life-span). Certain amino acids (such as leu, gln, ala, val, ile) might act as signaling molecules that modulate the starvation response by acting as anti-hunger signals. The amino acid signal activates AIY neurons and inhibits AIB neurons by modulating the activities of MGL-1 and MGL-2 metabotropic glutamate receptors in these neurons, respectively. AIY then inhibits the starvation response, whereas AIB activates it (Shen et al, 2010; Kang and Avery, 2009).</p>
