<p><strong>Function:</strong> Initially suggested to have neurohumoral function signaling the presence of food to the body since NSM's appear secretory by morphology and have processes that run in close apposition to the pseudocoelom over most of their lengths (<a href="http://www.wormatlas.org/albertson_1975/results.html">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowSection&#38;rid=ce2.section.820" target="_blank">Avery and Thomas, 1997</a>). They were postulated to sense bacteria in their lumen by their proprioceptive endings and transmit this to the rest of the body by secretions to the pseudocoelomic fluid. The presence of food leads to increased pharyngeal pumping, decreased locomotion and increased egg-laying behavior. Exogenous application of serotonin also induces these responses supporting the hypothesis NSM's can function neurohumorally by serotonin secretion. However, ablation of NSM's have only subtle effects on pumping suggesting they may not play any important role in this behavior (<a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/134/2/455" target="_blank">Avery et al., 1993</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowSection&#38;rid=ce2.section.820">Avery and Thomas, 1997</a>). When placed on a bacterial lawn, previously food-deprived animals slow down their locomotion to a higher degree compared to well-fed animals. This phenomenon is described as "the enhanced slowing response". When NSM's are ablated there is a small but significant decrease in the enhanced slowing response suggesting NSM's contribute to this behavior (<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/paper?name=WBPaper00004195;class=Paper" target="_blank">Sawin et al., 2000</a>).<br />
