<p>Function: - Functions in thermotaxis: AFD neurons are the main thermosensors in C. elegans and laser ablation of the AFD pair makes most animals athermotactic (Ma and Shen, 2012; Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008; Satterlee et al., 2004; Mori and Ohshima, 1995). After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Animals sense and record their Tc by AFD (major thermosensory), AWC and ASI neurons (Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al., 2008; Biron et al., 2008). This memory is plastic and can be reset upon cultivation at a different temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). The AFD, AWC and ASI neurons may to act in concert to increase turning rate when animals encounter higher temperatures than Tc on a gradient to move down the gradient toward colder temperatures near Tc (negative thermotaxis) (Biron et al., 2008). To track isotherms, animals do not actively pursue isothermal alignment, but once serendipitously aligned along an isotherm (at T=Tc), they track by suppressing turns (Luo et al., 2006).This may be achieved by the animal increasing its reversal frequency when it detects a rise in temperature, which activates Ca++ influx in AFD via cGMP-dependent TAX-2/TAX-4 cation channel (cGMP production in AFD is redundantly carried out by GCY-8, GCY-18 and GCY-23 and gcy-23, gcy-8, and gcy-18 triple mutants show a cryophilic or athermotactic phenotype) (Inada et al., 2006). AFD neurons respond to thermal stimuli above Tc with continuous, graded calcium signals in a deterministic and highly reproducible way. The thermal information is transmitted by AFD and AWC to AIY interneurons for information processing, and AIY neurons, in turn, transmit it to AIZ and RIA interneurons for further processing. It is suggested that activation of AFD neurons by warming above Tc induces the animal to reverse by inhibiting AIY since loss of AFD (by ablation) suppresses spontaneous reversals in an AIY-dependent manner, while loss of AIY (by ablation) increases spontaneous reversals (de Bono and Maricq 2005; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003).<br />
- Functions in locomotion: Laser ablations of AFD cause hyporeversal phenotype (Tsalik and Hobert, 2003).<br />
- AFD, BAG and ASE are primary CO2 sensors: AFD and BAG neurons together stimulate turning when CO2 rises and inhibit turning when CO2 falls (Bretscher et al., 2011).<br />
- May be involved in social feeding since disruption of tax-2 expression in AFD, AQR, ASE and BAG neurons disrupts social feeding (Coates and de Bono, 2002).<br />
