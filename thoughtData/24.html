<p>Function: Integration of information from amphid sensory neurons; AIZL/R is one of the four first layer amphid interneuron pairs (AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ) that receive and process synaptic output from the amphid sensory neurons towards a behavioral response. Along with the second layer RIA and RIB interneurons, AIZ also receives heavy input from the first layer AIA, AIB, AIY interneurons and itself sends inputs to RIA and RIB. Additionally, it synapses directly onto SMB head motor neurons .<br />
- Functions in thermotaxis; laser ablation of the AIZ pair makes the animals thermophilic (Mori and Ohshima, 1995). The thermal information sensed by AFD, AWC and ASI is processed in downstream interneurons AIY, AIZ, RIA, and also likely in AIA and AIB (the first three are considered as thermotaxis core interneurons) (Ma and Shen, 2012; Sasakura and Mori, 2012; Ardiel and Rankin, 2011; Beverly et al, 2011). In the original two-drive model of thermotaxis, activation of AIY neuron-signaling drive warm-seeking (thermophilic) movement, activation of AIZ neuron-signaling drive cold-seeking (cryophilic) movement, while the counterbalancing between the AIY and AIZ signals possibly through the RIA interneuron leads to execution of motor output in response to thermal signals (Ohnishi et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008). However, there is evidence that a thermophilic drive at temperatures below cultivation temperature (Tc) does not exist and regulation of thermotaxis involves a more complex circuit (Ma and Shen, 2012; Ryu and Samuel, 2002). Around Tc animals track isothermally on a gradient and above Tc they display negative thermotaxis by regulating their turning frequency and run duration. It has been suggested that thermosensory signals from AFD, AWC and ASI converge on the AIB interneuron in negative thermotaxis, whereas the AIY/AIZ/RIA network may function mainly in isothermal tracking (Ma and Shen, 2012).<br />
During associative learning between temperature and feeding state, starvation, a conditioning factor, downregulates AIZ activity through calcineurin/TAX-6, a calcium-activated phosphatase, leading to avoidance from Tc (Kuhara and Mori, 2006).<br />
- Functions in locomotion: Laser ablations of AIZ, like AIB and AWC, cause decrease in reversals and lead to large increases in the duration of forward movement (Tsalik and Hobert, 2003; Iino and Yoshida, 2009). Since ablations of AIY and AIZ cause opposite behavioral phenotpes, the synapses made by AIY onto AIZ may be inhibitory. Alternatively, signals fom AIY to AIZ could be processed in a downstream neuron such as RIA (de Bono and Maricq 2005).<br />
- Functions in chemotaxis: Laser ablations of AIZ cause defects in the weathervane (slow turning of the animal by biased head swing) and pirouette (bout of sharp turns generated by frequent reversals followed by omega turns) responses (see Nervous System-General Description) leading to impaired chemotaxis (Iino and Yoshida, 2009).</p>
